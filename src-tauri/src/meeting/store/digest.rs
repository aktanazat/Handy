//! D20: what one local day held, counted from the store.
//!
//! Four numbers, each read from the thing that already owns it: meetings from
//! the sessions that actually began capturing, loops closed from the receipts
//! D18's resolve mutation wrote, suggestions waiting from the pending learning
//! queue, and overdue handoffs from D27's direction on the corpus ledger walk.
//! Nothing here writes, and nothing here decides whether a notification is
//! worth raising — that is `crate::meeting::digest`'s call.
