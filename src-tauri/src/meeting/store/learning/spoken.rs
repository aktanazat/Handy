//! Loop 1: spoken symbol phrases the replacement engine does not cover yet.
//!
//! # Why the candidates are phrases, not words
//!
//! Accepting a suggestion here writes a [`ReplacementRule`], and
//! [`crate::audio_toolkit::apply_text_replacements`] matches a rule
//! case-insensitively at every Unicode token boundary, preferring the longest
//! rule at a position. A rule whose spoken form is the bare word `dot`
//! therefore rewrites *polka dot* into *polka .* — the boundary check passes,
//! because a space is a boundary. Nothing downstream can recover from that: the
//! written form is inserted verbatim and never rescanned.
//!
//! So the hazard is not handled by a filter. It is handled by never generating
//! such a candidate:
//!
//! * A candidate is always either a multi-word phrase or an unambiguous noun,
//!   the same rule [`crate::settings::default_replacement_rules`] documents for
//!   the shipped starter library.
//! * Domain candidates are `dot` **plus the suffix**, and are counted only where
//!   the reading is syntactically live — a bare word label immediately before,
//!   which is what makes it a domain rather than a sentence.
//! * A precision floor over the whole corpus is the last gate: if most of a
//!   user's `dot`s are the English word, no `dot`-headed rule is offered at all,
//!   however live the few domain readings look.
//!
//! # What this loop deliberately does not own
//!
//! Sentence punctuation — comma, period, full stop, question mark, exclamation
//! mark, new line, new paragraph — belongs to
//! [`crate::audio_toolkit::apply_literal_punctuation`], which is gated on the
//! per-mode `literal_punctuation` choice. Suggesting a replacement rule for one
//! of those would both duplicate that owner and quietly override a user who
//! turned that choice off, so [`OWNED_ELSEWHERE`] names them and
//! [`written_forms`] removes them before anything can propose one.
