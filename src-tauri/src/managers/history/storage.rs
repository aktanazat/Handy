//! Encryption at rest for the dictation history database.
//!
//! Opening the database never touches the OS credential store, so the first
//! window paint cannot wait behind a keychain prompt. Startup order:
//!
//! 1. [`HistoryStorage::at_startup`] reads the file header and picks a state. A
//!    plaintext file serves reads and writes immediately; a missing or already
//!    encrypted file starts locked.
//! 2. The app builds and shows its window.
//! 3. [`HistoryStorage::unlock`] resolves the key off the critical path, applies
//!    the one time plaintext to encrypted migration, and publishes the state
//!    every later connection uses.
//!
//! A key or migration failure keeps a plaintext database readable and writable
//! and records the reason, so history never disappears because a keychain is
//! locked.
