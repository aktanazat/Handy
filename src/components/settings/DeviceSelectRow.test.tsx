/* The trigger is the only place a device row reports which device is in
 * effect, and it is handed a PERSISTED name against a list enumerated at
 * render time. Those two disagreeing is a routine state, not an error path: a
 * USB mic gets unplugged, an enumeration has not resolved yet, a file the
 * setting still names is gone. What the trigger says in that state is the whole
 * subject of this file, and it is the contract the move from `ui/Dropdown` to
 * bare Radix `Select` silently dropped — Radix portals a label into the trigger
 * only out of a mounted, selected `SelectItem`, so a row that maps just the
 * enumerated devices and passes `SelectValue` no children renders BLANK.
 *
 * These assertions come from the deleted `ui/Dropdown.test.tsx`, which pinned
 * exactly this and went out with the primitive.
 *
 * Note on the harness: zustand serves `getServerSnapshot` under
 * `renderToStaticMarkup`, so store VALUES read as their initial state while
 * store METHODS (`getSetting`, `isUpdatingKey`) read live. That is why the
 * enumeration is a prop on this component and the setting is not: the list can
 * be varied here, and `isLoading` stays initially `true`, which is why every
 * control below paints disabled. Disablement is not what these tests are
 * about — the row must name its device in every one of these states,
 * including while it is too early to change it. */
